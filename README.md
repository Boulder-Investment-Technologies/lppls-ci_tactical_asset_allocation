# LPPLS-CI for Tactical Asset Allocation

Hello!

All of the project dependencies are encapsulated in a conda environment named `avoiding_bubbles`. Whatever system is hosting this project will need an installation of anaconda or miniconda if you would like to install and activate the `avoiding_bubbles` environment. Setup instructions are below. 

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Conda installation instructions can be found here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

### Creating conda env

From the project root run:

`conda env create -f environment.yml && conda activate avoiding_bubbles`

Next open the jupyter notebook:

`jupyter notebook`

You should now be able to browse to http://localhost:8888 and view the research project. All of the interesting things you will want to review live in the `lppls-ci-for-tactical-asset-allocation.ipynb` jupyter notebook. Navigate there within the jupyter UI and run all the cells!

```

## Note on the `data/` Dir
All of the data generated by the notebook is cached in the data/ directory. If you would like the notebook to fetch/generate fresh data, you can delete the universe.csv and/or the confidence.csv file(s). The notebook should detect that the file(s) no longer exist and refetch or regenerate accordingly.
